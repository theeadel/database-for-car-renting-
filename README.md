The database for our peer-to-peer car rental app is designed to efficiently manage all aspects of the rental process,
ensuring smooth transactions between car owners and renters. It consists of several interconnected tables that store
comprehensive information about users, cars, bookings, and reviews.
The database is designed with relational integrity constraints to ensure data consistency and accuracy.
It provides a solid foundation for our peer-to-peer car rental platform, facilitating seamless interactions between users, cars, bookings, and payments.
